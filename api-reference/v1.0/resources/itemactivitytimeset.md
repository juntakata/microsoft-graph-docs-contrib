# itemActivityTimeSet resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The **itemActivityTimeSet** resource provides information about when an [activity][activity] on an item took place.

>**Note:** Item activity records are currently only available on SharePoint and OneDrive for Business.

[activity]: itemactivity.md

## Properties

| Property name    | Type           | Description
|:-----------------|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------
| observedDateTime | DateTimeOffset | When the activity was observed to take place.
| recordedDateTime | DateTimeOffset | When the observation was recorded on the service.

The difference between **observed** and **recorded** times is especially important for offline collaboration scenarios.
If a user comments on a file while offline, the time that they make the comment is set as the **observedDateTime**.
At a later time when the user reconnects to the cloud and the changes get uploaded, that later time is set as the **recordedDateTime**.
